## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze food additives through both structured data and unstructured text. It provides insights into the types, categories, and public perception of additives by combining:

- **Data cleaning and visualization**
- **Text analysis with NLP**
- **Interactive visual reporting in Power BI**

## 1. Food_Addictives.ipynb

### Objective
Analyze the food additives dataset to identify usage trends, common classifications, and distribution across categories.

### Key Tasks
- Load and inspect dataset
- Clean missing values and remove duplicates
- Explore additive features
- Visualize top additives, categories, and classifications using bar charts and pie charts

### Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## 2. Food_Addictives_NLPipynb.ipynb

### Objective
Apply NLP techniques to the textual descriptions of food additives to extract meaningful insights and sentiment patterns.

### Key Tasks
- Preprocess text: tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
- Analyze word frequency
- Generate word clouds
- Perform sentiment analysis using TextBlob

### Libraries Used
- `nltk`
- `wordcloud`
- `textblob`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

## 3. Food_Additives_Dashboard.pbix

### Objective
Enable interactive exploration of the dataset using Power BI.

### Features
- Visual breakdown of additive classifications and categories
- Drill-down charts and filters for exploring specific additives
- Integrated summary metrics for better decision support
